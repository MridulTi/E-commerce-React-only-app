### Features

#### Dashboard
- Display a list of products with pagination.
- Implement a product search feature.
- Allow users to add products to the cart, with cart data stored in the browser's local storage.

#### Cart Page
- Display a list of selected products along with their quantities.
- Show the total price of the items in the cart.
- Provide options to:
  - Add/remove items from the cart.
  - Adjust the quantities of items.
  - Clear the cart completely.

### Requirements

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application should be fully responsive and optimized for both **web** and **mobile** views.

2. **API Calls**:
   - Use **Axios** to make API calls to the dummy server at [https://dummyjson.com/docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs).
   - It is recommended to create custom hooks for fetching data using Axios.

3. **UI/UX**:
   - Utilize **Material UI** or another CSS framework of your choice for styling and component design.
   - Ensure consistent theming and layout throughout the project.

4. **Browser Storage**:
   - Store the cart data in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage** to persist the cart between page reloads.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Ensure proper error handling for API calls.
   - Implement proper input validation (for example, when adjusting item quantities).

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 1,

      "description": "Product Description",
      "price": 100,
      "image": "product-image-url"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 100,
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 10
